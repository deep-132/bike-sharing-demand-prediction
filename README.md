# bike-sharing-demand-prediction
In this project, we train a model to predict the number of bike rentals at any hour of the year given the weather conditions. The data set was from Boom Bike service in Washington, D.C. from Kaggle which contained the historical bike usage pattern with weather data spanning two years.
